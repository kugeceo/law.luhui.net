lang=EN-US>,the market price of the goods should be determined by reference to 
    similar trading terms. Though the claimant adjusted the information of ‘Metals 
    Weekly’ by incorporating these payment terms, this price did not reflect the 
    delivery terms of the original contract and could not, therefore, be used 
    as the basis for determining an acceptable market price. According to the

    to the respondent 1,000 metric tonnes of ferrosilicon at the FOB price of 
    US$522 per metric tonne. The other terms of delivery under that offer were 
    basically similar to the terms of the contract. During the hearing, Mr Yang 
    Shigong, representative of the respondent, explained that he was not aware 
    of this offer as he was away on business at that time. The arbitration tribunal

style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt' lang=EN-US><strong>DISCUSSION</strong><o:p></o:p></span><br>
    　　<span class="cjn" style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'
lang=EN-US>The dispute occurred in early 1991 when the price of ferrosilicon in 
    the international market increased rapidly. The price for the goods fixed 
    in the contract was far below the rising market price. The seller requested 
    that the contractual price of the goods be raised. The buyer accepted the 
    seller's request and issued an L/C in the amount of the price of the goods 
    under the new contract, but the seller was unable to source the goods.<o:p></o:p><br>
    　　</span><span class="cjn"
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt' lang=EN-US>The facts of the 
    case showed that although the price of the goods soared inside a short period 
    of time, it did not reach a level which ‘could not be anticipated’ at the 
    time of concluding the contract. Goods could still be sourced on the market 
    at a higher price. Therefore, the contract was not void nor did ‘force majeure’ 
    occur. The seller did not deny its responsibility for the breach of contract 
    and agreed to compensate the buyer for this. The seller thought perhaps that 
    the cost of performing the contract by buying goods at a high price would 
    more or less equal the amount of damages to be paid.<o:p></o:p><br>
    　　</span><span class="cjn"
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt' lang=EN-US>As the seller admitted 
    its breach of contract and expressed its willingness to pay compensation, 
    the major question was how to determine the losses suffered by the buyer and 
    the manner of compensation. In the contract, liquidated damages were to be 
    determined as follows: if the seller did not deliver the goods pursuant to 
    the contract, the buyer would be compensated for the replacement goods it 
    sourced and the seller would pay the difference between the price for the 
    goods under the contract and the price of the replacement goods. However, 
    the buyer did not buy replacement goods. It attempted to source replacement 
    goods but was unsuccessful. The losses it claimed before the arbitration tribunal 
    comprised the compensation payable by its ‘partner’ to other clients for cancellation 
    of other contracts for the sale and purchase of ferrosilicon. The buyer claimed 
    that this compensation was payable because of the non-delivery of goods by 
    the seller. The goods were bought for resale and the reselling was handled 
    by its ‘partner’. The buyer may not have been sure about the validity of this 
    evidence to support this claim, however, and during arbitration, it submitted 
    a supplementary request for compensation for the difference between the contract 
    price and the market price of the goods when the contract was declared void 
    on the basis that the same provision existed under the Convention.<o:p></o:p></span><br>
    　　<span class="cjn"
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt' lang=EN-US>The defence raised 
    by the lawyer representing the seller centred on the objection on the part 
    of the respondent to compensation based on the difference between the market 
    price and the contract price for the goods. He did not agree that the Convention 
    was applicable to this dispute. He reasoned that the contract had already 
    provided for the replacement of goods as the method for the determination 
    of compensation, and this excluded the alternative of compensation based on 
    the difference between the market and the contract price for the goods. The 
    contract provided that the applicable laws were to be the laws of </span><span class="cjn"><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>China</span></st1:place></st1:country-region></span> 
    <span class="cjn" style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'
lang=EN-US>, and this excluded the Convention and the laws of other countries. 
    The purpose of denying the applicability of the Convention was to oppose the 
    buyer's claim that used the market price of the goods as the basis for assessment 
    of compensation. The lawyer representing the seller also considered that the 
    actual losses claimed by the buyer were not connected with the case and could 
    not be admitted as evidence. In its decision, the arbitration tribunal did 
    not award all the claims of the buyer. It did, however, dismiss the defence 
    of the lawyer representing the seller and considered that the Convention was 
    applicable to this dispute. It agreed to use an acceptable market price of 
    the goods as the basis for the assessment of the losses suffered by the buyer.<o:p></o:p></span> 
    <br>
    <span class="cjn"
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt' lang=EN-US>　　It was stipulated 
    in the contract that the laws of </span><span class="cjn"><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>China</span></st1:place></st1:country-region></span> 
    <span class="cjn" style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'
lang=EN-US>were applicable in the event of a dispute. The buyer claimed that in 
    determining the method of compensation, the Convention should apply. This 
    was because it knew that there was a marked difference between the Foreign 
    Economic <i>Contract Law</i> and the Convention in the determination of the 
    manner of compensation.<o:p></o:p></span> <br>

    in </span><span class="cjn"><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

lang=EN-US> </span><span class="cjn" style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'
lang=EN-US>governing international sale of goods contracts is the <i>Foreign Economic 
    Contract Law</i>. The<i> Foreign Economic Contract Law </i>makes provision 
    for damages payable by a defaulting party to the other party to a contract. 
    Article 20 of the Foreign Economic Contract Law stipulates that, `The parties 
    may agree in the contract on the chargeable fine in the event of default payable 
    by the defaulting party to the other party. ‘The parties may also agree on 
    the method of calculating the liquidated damages payable in the event of default.’ 
    Article 18 of the <i>Foreign Economic Contract Law </i>stipulates that, ‘When 
    one of the parties is in breach of the contract by not performing the contract 
    or by performing the contract in a way that does not fulfilll the terms of 
    the contract, the other party is entitled to claim damages or seek other reasonable 
    remedies. When the other remedies cannot make up for the losses suffered by 
    the other party, the other party is still entitled to claim damages.’ Article 
    19 of the <i>Foreign Economic Contract Law </i>stipulates that, ‘The amount 
    of damages payable by the party committing the breach should be equal to the 
    losses suffered by the other party as a result of such a breach but should 
    not exceed the amount that should have been anticipated by the party committing 
    the breach at the time of concluding the contract.’ The Supreme Court of China 
    has issued the following explanation of the principle of compensation for 
    breach of contract embodied in the <i>Foreign Economic Contract Law </i>(the 
    Judicial Explanation): <o:p></o:p><br>
    　　</span><span class="cjn"
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt' lang=EN-US>When one of the 
    parties does not perform the contract or performs the contract in a way that 
    does not fulfilll the agreed terms of the contract, the party committing the 
    breach shall, apart from seeking other remedies or acting as otherwise specified 
    in the contract, compensate the other party for the losses suffered as a result 
    of such a breach. The compensation usually covers damage to or reduction or 
    loss of property, the expenses incurred in the attempt to mitigate or prevent 
    losses, and the benefit (profit in the case of international sale of goods 
    contracts) that should have been obtained if the contract were performed, 
    but the amount should not exceed the amount of loss that should have been 
    anticipated by the party committing the breach at the time of concluding the 
    contract<sup>1</sup>.<o:p></o:p><br>
    </span><span class="cjn" style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'
lang=EN-US>The lawyer representing the seller insisted that the<i> Foreign Economic 
    Contract Law</i> be used as the basis for the assessment of the amount of 
    compensation because he considered that its stipulations were advantageous 
    to the seller.<o:p></o:p><br>
    　　</span><span class="cjn"
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt' lang=EN-US>We can see that 
    the above provisions are all general principles on compensation and do not 
    cover specific methods of calculating compensation. It is stipulated in the 
    <i>Foreign Economic Contract Law </i>that the parties ‘may agree on the method 
    of calculating the amount of liquidated damages payable in the event of default.’ 
    The parties agreed in the contract that if the seller did not deliver the 
    goods; the buyer should be compensated for the replacement goods it sourced. 
    The seller was therefore to pay the difference between the contract price 
    of the goods and the price of the replacement goods. Though the buyer did 
    not buy replacement goods after the seller's breach of contract, the buyer 
    still suffered a loss. According to the Judicial Explanation, the amount of. 
    damages should include the expenses incurred in the performance of the contract 
    and mitigating losses and the profits obtainable if the contract was performed. 
    In trading transactions, profits should be the resale price difference less 
    the cost of the goods when sold. This is closely related to the difference 
    between the market price and the contract price for the goods.<br>
    　　</span><span class="cjn"
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt' lang=EN-US>The problem is that 
    the law does not make provision on whether the party suffering from the breach 
    is still entitled to claim the difference between the market price and the 
    contract price for the goods if it has neither taken remedies open to it nor 
    adhered to the manner of compensation as stipulated in the contract. There 
    is specific provision for this in the Convention. Article 75 of the Convention 
    stipulates that; ‘If the contract is declared void and the buyer has already 
    purchased replacement goods within a reasonable period of time after the declaration 
    of this voidance or the seller has already resold the goods in a reasonable 
    manner, the party claimin damages may obtain the difference between the contract 
    price for the goods and the price of the replacement goods and any other damages 
    provided for in Article 74.’ Article 76 provides that, `(1) If the contract 
    is declared void and the goods have a market price, the party claiming damages 
    may, if it has not made a purchase or resale pursuant to Article 75, obtain 
    the difference between the contract price and the market price of the goods 
    at the time when the contract is declared void and any other damages that 
    may be obtained pursuant to Article 74.’ Here, provision is made for compensation 
    based on the difference between the market price and the contract price for 
    the goods to substitute for compensation based on the cost of replacement 
    goods (on the part of the buyer) or the resale of goods (on the part of the 
    seller). If these provisions apply, the buyer's claim in this case for compensation 
    for the price difference should be awarded.<o:p></o:p><br>

    　　</span><span class="cjn"
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt' lang=EN-US>The lawyer representing 
    the seller misunderstood the implications of the provisions of the contract 
    and treated the choice of Chinese law as the governing law of the contract 
    as exclusive of the applicability of relevant international treaties. The 
    binding force of international treaties generally takes two forms according 
    to the different provisions of these treaties:<o:p></o:p></span><br>
    　　<span class="cjn" style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'
lang=EN-US>1. mandatory rules, which must apply to the parties concerned; and<o:p></o:p></span><br>
    　　<span class="cjn" style='font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt' lang=EN-US>2. optional rules, which can be applied 
    (are partly applicable), are inapplicable or are partly inapplicable to the 
    parties concerned as agreed between them.<o:p></o:p></span> <br>
    　　<span class="cjn" style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'
lang=EN-US>The Convention is an optional rule; Article 6 of the Convention provides 
    that, ‘The parties may opt for inapplicability of the Convention or may reduce 
    the scope or change the effect of any of the provisions of the Convention 
    subject to Article 12 hereof’, and the parties may specify in the contract 
    that the Convention is either not applicable or is partly applicable. Parties 
    to a contract should specify exclusion of the applicability of the Convention 
    to the contract, either by providing that all or part of the Convention is 
    not applicable, or by choosing to apply the laws of a third country which 
    is not a party to the Convention. If the parties choose to use the laws of 
    a country which is a party to the Convention as the governing law of the contract 
    or, even if they do not specify the applicability of the laws of any country, 
    the parties have not explicitly excluded the applicability of the Convention, 
    the Convention shall automatically apply. This is also a provision under the 
    Convention. Article 1 of Chapter 1 of the Convention stipulates, ‘(1) The 
    Convention is applicable to sale of goods contracts concluded by parties conducting 
    business in different countries, (a) if these countries are parties to the 
    Convention; or (b) if private international law leads to the applicability 
    of the laws of a country which is a party to the Convention.’<o:p></o:p><br>
    　　</span><span class="cjn"
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt' lang=EN-US>Finally, the lawyer 
    representing the seller misinterpreted Article 6 of the <i>Foreign Economic 
    Contract Law</i> as a rule of conflict of laws. Conflict of laws is a special 
    realm of private international law which, `specifies which laws of which country 
    are applicable to a particular civil case involving foreign interests.&quot; 
    The lawyer representing the seller based its arguments on the Judicial Explanation 
    and considered that Article 6 of the <i>Foreign Economic Contract Law</i> 
    was not applicable to this case and as a consequence neither was the Convention. 
    The Judicial Explanation comes from the Questions and Answers on the Application 
    of the Foreign Economic Contract Law of the Supreme People's Court of China 
    (the Questions and Answers) The purpose of the Questions and Answers is to 
    establish certain principles concerning the applicability of laws to foreign 
    economic contracts. The lawyer representing the seller probably based his 
    arguments on Article (5) of Section 2 of the Questions and Answers, which 
    states, ‘The laws agreed to by the parties or determined by the<o:p></o:p>　</span><span class="cjn" style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'
lang=EN-US>People's Court in accordance with the principle of closest relationship 
    as the laws applicable to the handling of disputes arising from a contract 
    should be substantive laws and do not include conflict of laws and procedural 
    law.’ The lawyer representing the seller considered that the Judicial Explanation 
    proved that the laws of </span><span class="cjn"><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>China</span></st1:place></st1:country-region></span> 
    <span class="cjn" style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'
lang=EN-US>applied to the contract, but that the applicable laws in question did 
    not include the provision of Article 6 of the Foreign Economic Contract Law 
    because it concerns only the rules of conflict of laws. To come to such a 
    conclusion, the lawyer representing the seller must have treated the international 
    treaties to which </span><span class="cjn"><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>China</span></st1:place></st1:country-region></span> 
    <span class="cjn" style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'
lang=EN-US>is a party as foreign laws, and thus misinterpreted the provisions 
    in his consideration of them in this dispute. In short, Article 6 of the<i> 
    Foreign Economic Contract Law </i>establishes the principle of the priority 
    of international conventions acceded to by </span><span class="cjn"><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>China</span></st1:place></st1:country-region></span> 
    <span class="cjn" style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'
lang=EN-US>and is not concerned with conflict of laws issues. The Questions and 
    Answers relied upon by the lawyer representing the seller also supports this 
    in Article (8) of Section 2 which provides that, ‘Where there is a difference 
    between the international treaties concluded by or acceded to by China and 
    the<i> Foreign Economic Contract Law</i> or other laws of China related to 
    economic contracts that involve foreign interests, the provisions of the international 
    treaties shall apply with the exception of provisions on which China has stated 
    its reservations.’ This is basically a reiteration of Article 6 of the<i> 
    Foreign Economic Contract Law.</i><o:p></o:p></span> <br>
    　　<span class="cjn"
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt' lang=EN-US>The above analysis 
    covers the dispute on the applicability of laws to contracts involving foreign 
    interests. Even if the countries of origin of the parties to the contract 
    were not parties to the Convention, or the Convention did not apply for other 
    reasons, and only the laws of China were applicable in this case, the buyer's 
    right to claim compensation based on the difference between the price of the 
    goods under the contract and the market price of the goods should not be denied. 
    Although there is no provision in the laws of </span><span class="cjn"><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>China</span></st1:place></st1:country-region></span><span class="cjn" style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'
lang=EN-US>　for compensation on this basis, Chinese law does not exclude compensation 
    based on the market price of goods in its principles. When the seller does 
    not make delivery of the goods, the buyer suffers losses even if replacement 
    goods are sourced. If the buyer does not source replacement goods pursuant 
    to the contract, the seller still has the responsibility to compensate the 
    buyer for the losses it suffered by reason of the seller's breach of contract, 
    which would include losses due to price difference of the goods.<o:p></o:p><br>
    　　</span><span class="cjn"
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt' lang=EN-US>In its application 
    for arbitration, the buyer raised five items of actual losses incurred. However, 
    only claims on the L/C charges, transportation costs and arbitration expenses 
    were granted by the arbitration tribunal. The other claims were dismissed. 
    The two types of claims dismissed included the losses suffered by the buyer's 
    business partner in the performance of a related contract, and expected profits. 
    The arbitration tribunal considered that the partner of the buyer was not 
    a party to the contract. In addition, the claimed partnership to buy and sell 
    ferrosilicon was not evidenced by written proof and could not be proved to 
    have been known by the seller. The losses suffered by its partner could not, 
    therefore, be claimed.<o:p></o:p><br>
    　　</span><span class="cjn"
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt' lang=EN-US>Under normal circumstances, 
    as an importer, the buyer would conclude a resale contract with its client. 
    When the seller breaches the contract, the damages payable under the resale 
    contract would become part of the claim for compensation. Under FOB terms, 
    the buyer has the obligation to hire a vessel to ship the goods. If the non-delivery 
    on the part of the seller results in losses in the hiring of shipping space, 
    these losses may also form part of the compensation claimed. However, the 
    buyer had not entered into a resale contract with its client and had not signed 
    a contract to hire shipping space. According to the buyer, these were the 
    responsibility of its partner. This is not a common practice in international 
    trade: The arbitration tribunal did not comment on this but concluded from 
    its analysis of the evidence of the ‘partnership’ that this evidence was not 
    convincing because the `partnership' was only an oral agreement, the contents 
    of which could not be proved to have been known by the seller.<o:p></o:p><br>
    　　</span><span class="cjn"
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt' lang=EN-US>One of the principles 
    established in the<i> Foreign Economic Contract Law</i> is the determination 
    of the scope of compensation. According to this principle the losses in this 
    case should have been anticipated by one of the parties at the time of concluding 
    the contract. The Convention contains a similar provision. Article 74 of the 
    Convention stipulates that, ‘The damages payable by the party that breaches 
    the contract shall be equal to the amount of the losses suffered by the other 
    party as a result of this breach, including the loss of profit. This amount 
    shall not exceed the amount that was or that should have been anticipated 
    by the party breaching the contract at the time of concluding the contract 
    from the facts and circumstances that it knew of or should have known of at 
    that time.’ The buyer's claim failed because its transaction with its partner 
    was not known by the seller and it was difficult for the seller to know of 
    this ‘partnership’. Moreover, the `partnership' claimed by the buyer was only 
    an oral agreement which was not convincing. Although the resale was effected 
    through a partner, a rare practice in trading transactions, as long as it 
    could be proved that the seller should have known of the existence of this 
    partnership, and that the performance of the contract between the buyer and 
    the seller was a condition of the conclusion of the resale contract by the 
    partner of the buyer, the losses suffered by the partner in being unable to 
    deliver the goods to its client under the resale contract as a result of the 
    breach of the first contract can be converted to losses of the buyer in accordance 
    with the provisions of the partnership agreement. It would, of course, be 
    much more difficult to determine losses in this case on this basis than it 
    would had the goods been resold directly.<o:p></o:p><br>
    　　</span><span class="cjn"
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt' lang=EN-US>The arbitration 
    tribunal also dismissed the buyer's claim for loss of profits. No analysis 
    was made, however. The buyer had not signed any resale contract, and it was 
    equally doubtful as to whether the resale profit of its partner could comprise 
    part of its losses. Also, as the arbitration tribunal agreed to grant the 
    buyer compensation based on the market price of the goods, the buyer could 
    only choose to receive compensation either on that basis or for loss of profits. 
    <o:p></o:p><br>
    　　</span><span class="cjn"
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt' lang=EN-US>The arbitration 
    tribunal supported the buyer's claim for the difference between the contract 
    price and the market price of the goods at the time the contract was declared 
    void. However, the arbitration tribunal did not accept the evidence of the 
    market price produced by the buyer as a reasonable basis for the calculation 
    of this difference for two reasons. First, the buyer incorrectly determined 
    the time when the contract was declared void, and second, the source of the 
    buyer's market price and its supporting documents did not reflect the terms 
    of the contract.<o:p></o:p></span><br>
    　　<span class="cjn"
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt' lang=EN-US>The issue of the 
    time of the contract was void was a matter of corroboration by evidence. The 
    arbitration tribunal required a more accurate determination of this date. 
    This was particularly important, it having occurred at a time when the price 
    of goods was volatile. A contract is declared void by the seller when the 
    seller informs the buyer that it cannot deliver the goods pursuant to the 
    contract; it is declared void by the buyer when the buyer informs the seller 
    that it is rejecting the goods or cancelling the contract. The declaration 
    of the voidance of the contract does not have to be in written form, but it 
    must be clearly understood by the other party. When one party is aware that 
    the other party cannot perform the contract, it has the right and the obligation 
    to take remedial action to mitigate its losses. Therefore, the date the contract 
    is declared void is the date at which losses can be determined.<o:p></o:p></span> 
    <br>
    　　<span class="cjn"
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt' lang=EN-US>The arbitration 
    tribunal did not agree to the use of the information in ‘Metals Weekly’ as 
    the basis for assessment of the market price of the goods. It determined that 
    the true price should be a price determined under similar terms of delivery, 
    whereas the price disclosed in `Metals Weekly' was the average price of ferrosilicon 
    in the </span><span class="cjn"><st1:country-region><st1:place><span

    <span class="cjn" style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'
lang=EN-US>market over a certain period of time. In the end, the arbitration tribunal 
    took as the basis for determining the market price the price in an offer provided 
    by the buyer submitted by a Chinese client under similar terms of delivery.<o:p></o:p></span> 
    <br>
    　　<span class="cjn"
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt' lang=EN-US>The question is, 
    what can be considered a reasonable place for determining the source of the 
    benchmark market price? Generally speaking, damages payable under an FOB contract 
    should be the difference between the contract price and the market price of 
    the goods at the place of delivery at the time the contract is declared void. 
    This is because when the buyer learns that the seller cannot deliver the goods, 
    it can source goods from other suppliers on the market at the place of delivery 
    in order to mitigate further losses. Moreover, using the place of delivery 
    as the basis for this determination makes it possible to assess the price 
    according to conditions similar to those of the original FOB contract price 
    and provides a basis for comparison. However, if there is no market at the 
    place of delivery, can the market price at the destination be used as the 
    basis for assessing damages? The buyer's claim using the market price in the 
    </span><span class="cjn"><st1:country-region><st1:place><span lang=EN-US
  style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>US</span></st1:place></st1:country-region></span><span class="cjn" style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'
lang=EN-US>, the destination, as the basis for assessing the losses cannot, strictly, 
    be denied. When there is no market price at the place of delivery, ie, when 
    the buyer cannot reasonably secure a new contract at the port of loading, 
    no fundamental error is committed by using the difference between the market 
    price at the port of destination and the contract price of the goods as the 
    basis on which to assess damages. This is because the seller should reasonably 
    know that the buyer is buying the goods for use or disposal at the designated 
    port of destination. In performing the calculation, however, freight and other 
    necessary charges payable by the buyer under FOB terms should be deducted.<o:p></o:p><br>
    　　</span><span class="cjn"
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt' lang=EN-US>As the arbitration 
    tribunal had evidence of the buyer's opportunity to obtain anew contract under 
    the same delivery terms, the determination of the market price at the place 
    of delivery was indisputable. In some circumstances, however, it is difficult 
    to determine the market price at the place of delivery, especially when the 
    price is highly volatile and it is difficult to obtain goods in the spot market, 
    and the buyer should not be required to assess damages on the basis of the 
    market price at the place of delivery.<o:p></o:p></span> <br>
