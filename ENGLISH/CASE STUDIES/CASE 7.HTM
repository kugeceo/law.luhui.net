          respondent submitted that the terms of the agreement relating to the 
          quality and unit price of the goods in the contract and the agreement 
          were the result of a gross misunderstanding between the parties and 
          obviously inequitable, and that the contract and the agreement should 
          be amended or cancelled. Upon investigation, the arbitration tribunal 
          found that the items being transacted for were specified in the contract 
          to be ¡®pieces of white cardboard (scrap paper)¡¯, while the agreement 
          signed between the parties and the user clearly stipulated that the 
          goods to be supplied by the respondent ¡®must be pure white pieces of 
          cardboard' and that `no other substance may be mixed with the goods'. 
          Also, during the hearing, the respondent acknowledged that it was a 
          professional firm that had been dealing in scrap paper for many years. 
          The arbitration tribunal held that any other reasonable person in the 
          same situation would probably not misunderstand such clear provisions. 
          In addition, the evidence submitted by the respondent was not sufficient 
          to convince the arbitration tribunal of the respondent's explanations. 
          The respondent's claim could not, therefore, be upheld: The provisions 
          relating to the quality and unit price of the goods under the contract 
          and in the agreement were not obviously inequitable, and the parties 
          should perform the contract accordingly. The respondent claimed that 
          the certificate of inspection provided by the claimant was issued after 
          the time limit specified in the agreement had expired and the certificate 
          of inspection was not, therefore, valid and could not be used as the 
          basis for claim. The arbitration tribunal held that it was stipulated 
          in the agreement that Party C (ie, the user) `must arrange for the inspection 
          of the quality of the goods within ten days of the arrival of the goods 
          at the port of destination and produce a written certificate.' This 
          clause specified the obligations of the user and did not contradict 
          clause 14 of the contract, that the buyer (the claimant) should claim 
          compensation on the basis of a certificate of inspection within 90 days 
          of the arrival of the goods at the port of destination. Moreover, the 
          port of destination specified in the contract was the port of Saiqi 
          in Wan, Fujian province, whereas the `date of import' specified on the 
          certificate of inspection was found by the arbitration tribunal to refer 
          to the date of entry of the goods into China. The actual date of arrival 
          of the goods at the port of Saiqi should be 18 August 1992. The date 
          of issue of the certificate of inspection was 27 August 1992. This showed

          Afterwards, in accordance with the verbal agreement reached between

          amount of damages payable to the claimant by the respondent as a result

          seller's lack of experience in this business.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

          cannot be met either. Firstly, the seller submitted that, ¡®In 1492, 
          the FOB price for pure white scrap cardboard in Hong Kong was HK$2,350 
          per tonne.¡¯ However, it could not provide sufficient evidence to support 
          its claim.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore its claim could not hold. Secondly, 
          even if the seller had provided sufficient evidence to support its claim, 
          it could not be concluded that the rights and obligations of the parties 
          were obviously contrary to the principles of equity, and of mutual benefit 
          and good consideration. In the first place, pure white scrap cardboard, 
          the contracted item, is a type of scrap paper and has no standard specification 
          or requirements. The seller could not prove that the contracted item 
          was the type of goods that was worth HK$2,350 per tonne. In the second 
          place, even if the seller could prove that the FOB price of the contracted 
          item in Hong Kong was HK$2,350 per tonne, it could not be established 
          that the price for the goods under the contract was obviously contrary 
          to the principles of equity and mutual benefit and consideration. This 
          is because the price for the goods under the contract was agreed to 
          by the parties, and the difference between the contract price and the 
          market price does not necessarily mean that an inequity has occurred. 
          Moreover, if the seller, as a professional firm dealing in scrap paper, 
          signed the contract being well aware that the price for the goods under 
          the contract was different from the market price, it would be difficult 
          for the seller to oppose the other party by invoking the principle of 
          equity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

          it can be seen that the claims submitted by the seller are not supported 
          by the two conditions for obvious inequity. It cannot be concluded that 
          the agreement as to the price for the goods is obviously inequitable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

          General Rules of the Civil Law, one of the parties may request the amendment 
          or cancellation of a civil act which exhibits gross misunderstanding 
          and obvious inequity. In other words, the parties involved may request 
          amendment or cancellation based on actual circumstances. In its defence, 
          the seller's request to ¡®amend or cancel' the agreement on the category 
          and price of the goods under the contract was ambiguous, as it did not 
          specify whether it wanted to amend or cancel. When forwarding this defence, 
          the seller did not make clear its definition of the legal principles 
          of gross misunderstanding and obvious inequity, which led to an inability 
          to make any further determinations that would have had to have been 
          based on these definitions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>There is currently 
          no specific provision in Chinese law on the return of goods. The <i>Convention 
          on the International Sale of Goods Contracts of the United Nations</i> 
          (the Convention) and the laws of other countries show that the return 
          of goods is a remedy available to the buyer when the goods delivered 
          by the seller do not fulfill contractual requirements, therefore constituting 
          a fundamental breach of the contract. As the return of goods is a remedy 
          that has serious consequences for the seller, indiscriminate use of 
          this remedy would seriously affect the interests of the seller and result 
          in a form of inequity. Strict conditions are usually laid down, therefore, 
          as to where and when this remedy may be adopted. First, goods delivered 
          by the seller must be inconsistent with the contract requirements, constituting 
          a fundamental breach of the contract. The Convention's definition of 
          a fundamental breach of contract is that the consequences of the breach 
          on the part of one of the parties cause damages to the other party to 
          such an extent that the other party is actually deprived of what it 
          is entitled to expect to obtain under the contract, unless such consequences 
          cannot be anticipated by the party committing the breach nor by a reasonable 
          person with similar qualifications under similar circumstances. Secondly, 
          the buyer must notify the seller within a reasonable period of time 
          after the non-conformance of the goods is discovered or should have 
          been discovered, stating the nature of the non-conformance and the decision 
          to reject the goods. Thirdly, the buyer must be able to return the goods 
          in the same condition as they were in at the time of receipt unless 
          the inability to return the goods in the condition as they were is caused 
          wholly by the seller.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
        <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:14.0pt;mso-char-indent-count:1.0;
mso-char-indent-size:14.0pt;line-height:16.0pt;mso-line-height-rule:exactly'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>In this case, the 
          goods received by the buyer were proved on inspection to be inconsistent 
          with the requirements defined in the contract. White scrap cardboard 
          accounted for only 34.96 per cent of the total weight of the goods. 
          The remainder comprised other types of paper and prohibited substances. 
          This was totally different from the pure white scrap cardboard expected 
          to be obtained by the buyer at the time the contract was concluded. 
          Therefore, the act of the seller can be determined to constitute a fundamental 
          breach of the contract. However, after it knew of the results of the 
          commodities inspection, the buyer agreed with the seller that it would 
          first pick suitable scrap paper from the goods for use. By entering 
          into such an agreement with the seller, the buyer actually relinquished 
          its right to cancel the contract and to request the return of the goods. 
          Later, the user picked 20 tonnes of suitable scrap paper from the goods 
          for use pursuant to the agreement between the buyer and the seller. 
          The buyer had thus taken action which contradicted the seller's title 
          to the goods. It was no longer possible for the buyer to return the 
          goods in the same condition as they were at the time of receipt. Under 
          these circumstances, the arbitration tribunal could not support the 
          buyer's request for the return of the goods.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>There is another 
          issue in the decision of this case worth discussion. The arbitration 
          tribunal dismissed the buyer's request for the return of the goods and 
          the refund of the moneys that it had paid and decided that the respondent 
          should pay compensation equal to a discounted price. It is of course 
          true that after losing the right to request the return of the goods, 
          the buyer was still entitled to claim compensation from the seller for 
          the losses caused by the non-conformance of the goods delivered. In 
          terms of procedure, however, the buyer did not, in its application for 
          arbitration, request compensation equal to a discounted price of the 
          goods under the contract. The decision of the arbitration tribunal proposes 
          this request which the buyer itself should have raised but did not. 
          This could be considered unfair to the seller. The arbitration tribunal 
          however, made its decision considering the actual fairness of the situation 
          against a question of fairness that arose from a failure to follow standard 
          procedure, and decided for the former.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
