    goods. Following production, Mr. Yang, director of the respondent, made a 
    phone call to the claimant refusing to perform the contract on grounds of 
    unacceptable fabrics. Despite the claimant's repeated requests, the respondent 
    insisted that it would neither inspect nor accept the goods. As a result, 
    the 11,000 jackets worth a total of Rmb505, 560 were put in stock and the 
    claimant, due to the non-performance of the contract by the respondent, suffered 
    heavy economic losses. In its application to the arbitration tribunal, the 
    claimant requested that the respondent immediately compensate it Rmb505, 560

    was the middleman. Both the claimant and the respondent were aware that the 
    goods would finally be delivered to NH Company. Therefore, the style, price, 
    quantity and quality of the goods had to be confirmed by NH Company. After 
    entering into the contract, the respondent provided the sample fabrics, but 
    the claimant sent unsuitable fabrics to the factory for processing. On 10 
    October 1989, the respondent noted that the color of the fabrics used by the 
    claimant did not match the sample and immediately informed the claimant that 
    the goods could not be accepted. However, having cut the fabrics and sent 
    them to the factory, the claimant continued to produce the goods. On 16 October 
    1989, the claimant sent sample fabrics to the respondent. The respondent replied 
    by fax that the sample fabrics had been received and sent on to NH Company. 
    NH Company confirmed that these samples did not conform to the sample of the 
    first batch of goods and that these fabrics could not be used. The respondent 
    asked the claimant to find a solution to this problem or NH Company would 
    not accept the goods. The claimant made no move other than to continue production.

    　　<span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>1. The 
    dispute between the parties <span class=SpellE>centred</span> on the quality 
    of the goods. Clause 6 of the contract on ‘Quality’ stated, ‘The seller (the 
    claimant) warrants the conformance of the quality, specifications and technical 
    details of the goods with the requirements for these under the contract (or 
    with the sample provided by the seller). In the event of non-conformance of 
    the goods, the seller shall be responsible for all consequences of this non-conformance.’ 
    However, the column, ‘description and specifications’ in the contract stated 
    only, `refer to the production list'. According to the materials presented 
    to the tribunal by the claimant, the ‘production list’ was the confirmation 
    of purchase signed by the respondent and a company in <span
class=SpellE>Quanzhou</span> (the processing factory). The column, ‘description 
    and specifications of goods’ stated only `jackets, N2811, N2812'. No detailed 
    provisions for the quality and specifications of the goods were included. 
    The L/C issued by the respondent also made no mention of the sample fabrics, 
    now in dispute, in the description of the goods.<o:p></o:p><br>
    　　</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>During performance of the contract, 
    the parties sought confirmation of the sample fabrics after signing the contract. 
    According to the information provided by the claimant, the claimant sent the 
    sample fabrics for the jackets to Mr. Wu of the respondent for confirmation. 
    On 4 October 1989, Mr. Wu signed a confirmation letter using the letterhead 
    of ‘<span class=SpellE>Fujian</span> Province Foreign Trade Corporation -<span class=SpellE>Quanzhou</span> 
    Branch’, to which the sample fabrics were attached. The claimant then sent 
    the cut fabrics to the factory for production. In its <span class=SpellE>defence</span>, 
    the respondent denied that Mr. Wu was the manager of its garment department 
    and refused to <span
class=SpellE>recognise</span> the sample fabrics confirmed by him: However; the 
    name card handed to the claimant by Mr. Wu showed the title, Garment Department 
    Assistant Manager of the respondent. Moreover; Mr. Wu was stationed in <span
class=SpellE>Quanzhou</span> and was responsible for supervising garment production. 
    The claimant therefore had reason to believe that Mr. Wu had confirmed the 
    sample fabrics in the capacity of a representative of the respondent. The 
    respondent claimed that it had supplied its sample fabrics to the claimant 
    after signing the contract. The respondent actually submitted the sample fabrics 
    only after the arbitration hearing and the sample submitted to the arbitration 
    tribunal bore no signature to confirm acceptance of the fabrics. Therefore, 
    the arbitration tribunal held that the sample fabrics signed by Mr. Wu should 
    be the fabrics that it would use as the basis for its judgment.<o:p></o:p><br>
    　　</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>After 
    the claimant cut the fabrics (which conformed to the sample fabrics) and started 
    production, the respondent telephoned the claimant on 10 October 1989 informing 
    it that the blue sample could not be accepted (no objection was raised to 
    the other fabrics). On 16 October 1989, it sent a further fax message informing 
    the claimant that it would not accept any of the samples because the respondent's 
    buyer refused to accept the goods. It was stipulated in the contract that 
    the delivery date for the goods was 25 October 1989. The respondent's refusal 
    to accept the goods only eight days before the date of delivery, despite its 
    previous confirmation of the samples, was a breach of the agreement between 
    the claimant and the respondent:<o:p></o:p><br>
    　　</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>2. The trading terms agreed 
    in the contract were FOB <span class=SpellE>Quanzhou</span>. Under these terms, 
    the principal obligations of the buyer were: to hire a vessel or to book the 
    necessary shipping space, to inform the seller of the name of the vessel and 
    the shipping date, and to bear all expenses and risks related to the goods 
    after they were loaded. In an FOB contract, therefore, it is a precondition 
    of the seller's shipping of the goods that the buyer hire the vessel or book 
    the shipping space. In this case, by refusing to hire a ship or to book necessary 
    shipping space to take delivery of the goods, the respondent, as the buyer, 
    did not fulfill its obligations<o:p></o:p></span><span lang=EN-US

style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>3. After examining the evidence 
    submitted by the claimant, the arbitration tribunal was of the view that the 
    claimant had grounds for claiming damages for the losses it suffered due to 
    its enforced storage of the finished goods. As the jackets were specially 
    produced to cater to the sales needs of the respondent, it was difficult for 
    the claimant to reduce its losses by selling the finished goods. Therefore 
    it was held that the amount of damages claimed by the claimant and the interest 
    claimed thereon were reasonable. The respondent should, within a reasonable 
    period of time after settling the damages, take delivery of the goods pursuant 
    to the contract.<o:p></o:p><br>

style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Under a sale of goods contract, 
    the goods delivered by the seller must conform to the quality agreed to between 
    the parties under the contract. This is a principle <span
class=SpellE>recognised</span> by the laws of all countries. Consequently, the 
    contract must be specific, detailed and clear in its description of the quality 
    of the goods. If the contract does not specify the quality of the goods or 
    does not make clear specifications for the quality of the goods, usual industry 
    practice or the usual practice in past transactions between the buyer and 
    the seller should be followed.<o:p></o:p><br>
    　　</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The analysis and judgment of 
    the arbitration tribunal showed that the terms of the contract were extremely 
    simple. It only stated the number of the goods as N2811 and N2812. The terms 
    of the contract were left simple because the parties had earlier signed a 
    principal contract for the sale and purchase of 64,000 waterproof jackets, 
    of which the majority had been delivered. The goods N2811 and N2812 were part 
    of this principal contract, but the parties were to confirm the price for 
    these two batches of goods later. Therefore, they signed the contract now 
    in dispute, however, the terms of the principal contract for the sale and 
    purchase of 64,000 jackets were also very simple. There was no description 
    of the specifications and materials for the goods. The L/C issued by the respondent 
    carried a more detailed description:<o:p></o:p><br>
    　　</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Goods: Pure cotton jackets

    cotton flannel imprinted with a map, 42 x 44, 24/13; lining for the sleeves: 
    100% nylon taffeta, 190 <span class=SpellE>tonnes</span>, matching colors;

    　　</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>A dispute arose between the 
    parties over the quality of the outer material of the jackets. There was only 
    a general description of the materials to be used and general specifications 
    of the materials in the L/C. It was difficult, on the basis of this meager 
    description, to determine whether the goods delivered by the seller conformed 
    to the requirements of the L/C. The reason the respondent did not accept the 
    goods was the non-conformance of the materials with the materials that had 
    been agreed upon according to a sample, <span class=SpellE>ie</span>, the 
    color was different from the color code and there were stripes on the fabrics. 
    The dispute then <span
class=SpellE>centred</span> on the sample fabrics. Under the contract and in the 
    L/C, however, there was no requirement for delivery against sample.<o:p></o:p><br>
    　　</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>After the parties entered into 
    the contract, the claimant sent a sample of the fabrics for the jackets to 
    Mr. Wu of the respondent for confirmation of the quality. The claimant attached 
    three small pieces of these fabrics to a piece of paper bearing the letterhead, 
    ‘<span class=SpellE>Fujian</span> Province Foreign Trade Corporation - <span
class=SpellE>Quanzhou</span> Branch’, writing next to them the words ‘dark grey, 
    blue and light olive’. Another line read ‘brown: as provided before’. Below 
    the first line of the letter, were the specifications ‘21 S/2 x 10S/ 1, 5140 
    canvas’. Mr. Wu signed this letter and wrote the date, which was 4 October 
    1989, below his signature.<o:p></o:p><br>
    　　</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>In its <span class=SpellE>defence</span>, 
    the respondent objected to the confirmation card signed by Mr. Wu because 
    Mr. Wu was only an ordinary officer and not the manager of the garment department. 
    The respondent had never <span class=SpellE>authorised</span> Mr. Wu to sign 
    the confirmation and he did not, therefore, have the power to confirm the 
    sample on behalf of the respondent. As the confirmation card did not bear 
    the signatures of the two parties and had not been immediately sealed, it 
    was just apiece of paper and had no official value. Here the representative 
    capacity of Mr. Wu came into question. Did he have the authority to confirm 
    the sample? It was true that he did not have a letter of authorization signed 
    by the respondent. However, judging from the circumstances of the entire transaction, 
    the contracting parties had, before this transaction, already completed several 
    other transactions that also involved jackets in performance of the principal 
    contract for 64,000 jackets. From the outset, the respondent had appointed 
    representatives to be stationed at the factories to supervise the production 
    of the garments. Mr. Wu was one of these, representatives. The parties' usual 
    practice had been for the representative of the respondent stationed at the 
    processing factory to confirm the sample fabric before the materials were 
    used for production. Upon completion of each batch of garments, the products 
    could only be delivered after being inspected and passed by these representatives. 
    Several transactions involving jackets between the parties were conducted 
    in this manner, and the respondent had never disputed the arrangement.<o:p></o:p><br>
    　　</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Legally speaking, the action 
    of the respondent comprised ‘agency by <span class=SpellE>estoppel</span>’. 
    In other words, when A shows by its actions that B has the capacity as its 
    agent and C believes on this basis that B has the capacity as the agent' of 
    A and enters into an agreement with B, A cannot deny the agreement. Moreover; 
    the name card given by Mr. Wu to the claimant actually showed that Mr. Wu 
    was the assistant manager of the garment department of the respondent. He 
    was also sent to the processing factory of the claimant to supervise the production 
    of the garments directly. As an operations manager of the respondent, he should 
    have the general power of an agent. The arbitration tribunal therefore held 
    that the claimant indeed had reason to believe that Mr. Wu had confirmed the 
    sample fabrics in his capacity as a representative of the respondent and that 
    this confirmation was valid.<o:p></o:p><br>
    　　</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>After signing the contract, 
    the practice of the parties was to confirm the sample fabrics. The use of 
    the confirmation card signed by Mr. Wu was evidence that the parties had followed 
    a similar practice before: that the buyer would confirm the material and the 
    color of .the fabrics for the outer layer of the garments before production. 
    The line, `brown: as provided before' on the confirmation card meant that 
    the brown fabric had been confirmed before in previous production and there 
    was no need to reconfirm it this time. What is the legally binding effect 
    of such a practice? There is no specific provision dealing with this in the<i> 
    Foreign Economic Contract Law of the People's Republic of China</i> (the <i>Foreign 
    Economic Contract Law</i>). But Article 5 of the Foreign Economic Contract 
    Law provides that `International practices are applicable to any issues not 
    provided for in the laws of the People's Republic of China.’ Clause 1 of Article 
    9 of the Convention on International Sale of Goods Contracts of the United 
    Nations provides that any established practices agreed between contracting 
    parties and any usual practices established between them shall be binding 
    on both parties. The confirmation of the sample fabrics could be considered 
    a usual practice established by the parties in their preceding transactions 
    and should be binding upon them.<o:p></o:p><br>
    　　</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>In their performance of the 
    contract, the parties adopted transaction practices which involved both sampling 
    and descriptions of the materials. A sample in this case was not a finished 
    product in itself but part of the product, <span class=SpellE>eg</span>, the 
    sample fabrics for the outer layer of the garments. The sample was provided 
    by the seller and confirmed by the buyer: Therefore, the goods produced by 
    the claimant according to these sample fabrics should not be disputed as far 
    as the material for the outer layer of the garments was concerned. In its 
    <span
class=SpellE>defence</span>, the respondent denied that Mr. Wu was the manager 
    of its garment department and also that the sample fabric confirmed by Mr. 
    Wu was an <span class=SpellE>authorised</span> sample. It claimed that it 
    had provided sample fabrics to the claimant and that the garments delivered 
    by the claimant did not conform with these sample fabrics. Based on facts 
    which were confirmed by investigation, the arbitration tribunal rejected the 
    arguments of the respondent and held that the sample fabrics confirmed by 
    Mr. Wu should be taken as the materials for production.<o:p></o:p><br>

style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The recognition by the arbitration 
    tribunal that the sample fabrics confirmed by Mr. Wu should be taken as the 
    materials for production had the effect of resolving all subsequent issues. 
    The respondent could no longer refuse to accept the goods on grounds of non-conformance 
    with the sample fabrics, and the claimant had the right to claim damages from 
    the respondent if the respondent refused to hire a ship or book necessary 
    shipping space to take delivery of the goods.<o:p></o:p></span></div>
