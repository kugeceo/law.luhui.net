          of March and 5,000 kg for the month of April. Upon receipt of the purchase

          would deliver 5,000 kg of goods in March and 5,000 kg of goods in April. 
          Later, due to production problems, the respondent was unable to deliver

          delivery date and the LIC be amended. On 14 April 1990, in response

mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The first batch of 5,000 kg of goods delivered by the 
          respondent was received by the claimant in early August 1990. After 
          taking delivery, the claimant resold 2,000 kg of the goods to a Swiss 
          client and 3,000 kg to a French client. After inspection, both clients 
          informed the claimant that the goods were poor quality and claimed compensation 
          from the claimant. On 30 August 1990 and 13 September 1990, the claimant 
          notified the respondent of the above situation, With regard to the goods 
          purchased by the Swiss client, the claimant said that it had been to 
          the client's office and sampled the goods. It was found that the purity 
          of the goods was very low. Out of the 2,000 kg of goods, 440 kg were 
          used for trial. The trial production failed and the goods were abandoned. 
          The other 1,560 kg of goods were still in the original unopened barrels. 
          In the notice, the claimant said that these goods were too low in purity 
          and it seemed that they could only be thrown away or taken back by the 
          respondent. With regard to the goods purchased by the French client, 
          the claimant said that it had already accepted the request of the French 
          client to take back the goods. The claimant requested that the respondent 
          reply on the above issues as soon as possible. On 14 September 1990, 
          the respondent replied to the claimant requesting that the goods to 
          be returned should remain unopened. Repayment of the entire amount paid 
          on the goods should be allowed to be made within 30 days of the goods 
          being returned. The claimant considered that the respondent's reply 
          was not reasonable and would possibly cause greater losses to the claimant. 
          The claimant therefore made an agreement with its clients that it would 
          dispose of the goods at a discount of 50 per cent. The claimant submitted 
          the case to the Shenzhen Branch of the Commission on 6 June 1991</span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:

          delivered in March. After conclusion of the contract and the issue of

          delivery of the first batch of five tonnes of goods, the respondent 
          never, delivered the other 15 tonnes of goods: Therefore, the respondent 
          should compensate the claimant for its losses suffered as a result of 
          the respondent's refusal to deliver the 15 tonnes of goods. The compensation 
          should be calculated at the rate of US$2 per kg. In its first defence, 
          the respondent submitted that the contract stipulated payment would 
          be made by irrevocable L/C payable at sight. As the claimant was unable 
          to issue an L/C to the respondent, the respondent was unable to perform 
          its obligation of delivery. Therefore there was no refusal to deliver 
          the goods. In its subsequent supplementary submission, the respondent 
          further claimed that the purchase order issued by the claimant after 
          conclusion of the contract specified that the quantity of goods it had 
          ordered equalled 10,000 kg of goods, being 5,000 kg for the month of 
          March and 5,000 kg for the month of April. The purchase order was a 
          specific request made by the claimant as the buyer under the contract. 
          The notice of amendment to the L/C issued later by the claimant also 
          specified that 5;000 kg of goods were to be delivered before 30 April 
          1990 and 5,000 kg of goods before 31 May 1990. Thereafter, the claimant 
          had repeatedly wired to enquire about the delivery of the 10 tonnes 
          of goods confirmed under the purchase order. The other 10,000 kg of 
          goods under the contract were never mentioned. The respondent considered 
          that the purchase order and the L/C issued by the claimant, in addition 
          to the confirmation of the respondent, showed that the parties had come 
          to a new agreement as to the quantity of goods to be delivered and the 
          time of delivery of the goods and had amended the original contract 
          accordingly. On 30 July 1990, the claimant sent another cable regarding 
          20,000 kg of goods. This was a new request after the amendment of the 
          contract. Taking into consideration the production conditions at that 
          tame, the respondent had never accepted this request. No new agreement 
          had been reached. Therefore the claimant had no grounds for raising

          was the result of <i>force majeure</i> and following this the parties

          1990, the claimant issued a purchase order to the respondent on 14 February 
          1990 specifying the quantity of the goods to be ordered as 5,000 kg 
          for the month of March and 5,000 kg for the month of April. Though the 
          purchase order did not show the quantity of goods to be purchased for 
          the months of May and June as specified in the contract, it made specific 
          reference to the contract dated 23 January 1990. The claimant did not, 
          through purchase orders or otherwise, express its intention to cancel 
          the agreement to purchase the goods to be delivered in May and June 
          pursuant to the contract. In the telex messages sent to the respondent 
          by the claimant on 15 May 1990, 17 May 1990, 29 May 1990 and 11 June 
          1990, references were also made in the caption to the contract on the

          to whether the purchase order implied a change in the quantity of goods 
          to be purchased under the contract. Nor did it confirm its consent to 
          this change after it determined that the purchase order implied an amendment 
          to the contract. On the contrary, it expressly apologised to the claimant 
          in the letter dated 1 June 1990 for its inability to deliver the outstanding 
          15 tonnes of goods on time because of funding problems. In the letter 
          dated 9 November 1990, the respondent promised that it could supply 
          the outstanding 15 tonnes of goods at the 1991 international market 
          price. The parties had all along, therefore, clearly endeavored to honour 
          the term regarding the quantity of goods agreed upon under the contract. 
          They had neither, discussed nor issued any written notice on amendment 
          of the contract, nor had they entered into any written agreement to 
          amend the contract. Therefore the claim of the respondent that the purchase 
          order issued by the claimant constituted a request to amend the quantity 
          of goods ordered under the contract could not hold. The respondent should 
          be responsible for the losses suffered by the claimant as a result of 
          its inability to deliver 15 tonnes of goods pursuant to the contract.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

          be concluded when the parties agree on the terms of the contract in

          Law also provides that any notice of or agreement on the amendment or 
          cancellation of a contract shall be in writing. During the drafting 
          of the Convention in 1980 in Vienna, the participating nations had a 
          heated debate over whether international sale of goods contracts should 
          be made in writing. A compromise was finally reached. It was agreed 
          that it was not necessary for international sale of goods contracts 
          to be made in writing. A sale of goods’ contract could be proven in 
          any manner, including by a witness. However, countries that insisted 
          on written contracts could make a reservation at the time of acceding 
          to the Convention to the effect that any provisions in the Convention

          by agreement, or any quotation, acceptance and conveyance of messages 
          in any form other than in writing shall not be applicable. When acceding

          case: in its defence, the respondent submitted that after the contract 
          on the 20,000 kg of goods was signed and took effect; it was indicated 
          in both the purchase order and the L/C issued by the claimant that the 
          total quantity of goods to be delivered was to be 10;000 kg. This was 
          confirmed by the respondent and the original contract was amended by 
          the parties to the contract to this effect. The validity 2of' this claim 
          was directly related to the respondent's responsibility for the outstanding 
          10,000 kg of goods. In fact, the parties had never agreed in writing 
          to cancel the transaction for the other 10,000 kg of goods. References 
          were also made to this 10,000 kg of goods in correspondence related 
          to the first 10,000 kg of goods. Therefore the amendment of the contract 
          was not in written form and did not fulfill the requirements for this 
          under the laws of China and the Convention. The parties had not validly 
          amended the quantity of goods to be delivered that was stipulated in 
          the original contract. Therefore the non-delivery of 10,000 kg of goods 
          was a default on the part of the respondent. It could not be argued 
          that the contract had been amended and that the respondent did not need 
          to fulfill its obligation to deliver. Therefore the respondent should 
          bear legal responsibility for non-delivery of the goods.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>When the seller 
          does not deliver the goods, the buyer may cancel the contract. If the 
          buyer suffers no loss as a result of its cancellation of the contract, 
          the contractual relationship between the parties may be terminated at 
          this point. If, however, the buyer suffers losses as a result of its 
          cancellation of the contract, the seller should compensate the buyer 
          for these losses. There are normally two methods for claiming compensation. 
          The first is for the buyer to purchase from the market the goods agreed 
          to be supplied under the contract and then to request that the seller 
          compensate it for its losses. The second is for the buyer to claim directly 
          from the seller the difference between the contract price and the market 
          price at the time of the seller's default. The claimant in this case 
          chose the second method. Where this latter method is used, it is necessary 
          to determine the market price in order to calculate the price difference. 
          Under the Convention two situations may determine market price, namely 
          the price of the goods on cancellation of a contract before the buyer 
          takes delivery and the price of the goods on cancellation of a contract 
          after the buyer takes delivery. The market price in the former situation 
          is the price at the time of the cancellation of the contract, whereas 
          the market price in the latter situation is the price at the time of 
          taking delivery of the goods (Article 76 of the Convention). The claimant 
          in this case made its claim before it received the latter 10,000 kg 
          of goods. The amount of compensation should be determined at the market 
          price of the goods at the time the claimant cancelled the contract.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>It is also stipulated 
          in the Convention that the buyer, when cancelling the contract, must 
          issue a notice of cancellation to the seller. What constitutes a notice 
          of cancellation of a contract? If, in a letter to the seller, the buyer 
          explicitly declares a contract void or cancels a contract by reason 
          of the seller's breach of contract, identification of the notice of 
          cancellation of the contract would be easy. It would also be relatively 
          easy to determine the market price of the goods at the time of the cancellation 
          of the contract. However, if the buyer grants to the seller a grace 
          period after the seller has committed a fundamental breach of contract 
          and explicitly states that remedies will be sought if the seller does 
          not perform the contract within the grace period, does it imply that 
          the buyer has issued a notice of cancellation of the contract? This 
          type of notice should be deemed to be advance notice of cancellation. 
          When the seller does not perform the contract within the grace period, 
          such advance notice would become a notice of cancellation of the contract 
          and there would be no need for the buyer to reiterate this. The market 
          price should be determined according to the market price at the time 
          the buyer issues the advance notice of cancellation. The arbitration 
          tribunal used this method to determine the market price of the goods 
          in this case. Apart from expressly declaring cancellation of a contract 
          in writing, a notice of cancellation is deemed to have been given if 
          it can be reasonably deduced from a letter that the party issuing the 
          letter has expressed its intention to cancel the contract even though 
          no explicit reference is made to the contract being ‘cancelled’ or ‘void’. 
          In calculating price difference, the date of issue of this letter can 
          be used as the date for determining the market price.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

          in the case is the acceptance of goods. Taking delivery of goods and 
          acceptance of goods are two different legal concepts and, accordingly, 
          different rights of the parties are determined by them. Taking delivery 
          of goods is only a part of the process of handing over goods. Taking 
          delivery can only prove that the seller has delivered and the buyer 
          has received the goods and does not necessarily imply that the person 
          taking delivery has accepted the goods. Acceptance of goods implies 
          that the buyer confirms that the seller has delivered goods which fulfill 
          the contractual requirements for the goods and also implies that the 
          seller has performed its agreed obligations. The buyer, upon acceptance 
          of the goods, has the unconditional obligation to make payment. If the 
          buyer accepts the goods, it loses the right to reject the goods.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>In between taking 
          delivery of goods and acceptance of goods, inspection occurs. It is 
          only after inspecting the goods that the buyer can determine whether 
          the goods fulfill contractual requirements and decide whether to accept 
          the goods delivered by the seller. The buyer should have a reasonable 
          opportunity and a reasonable period of time to inspect the goods. Given 
          reasonable opportunity, if the buyer does not inspect the goods within 
          a reasonable period of time, it effectively accepts the goods. It is 
          stipulated in the Convention that, `The buyer must notify the seller 
          of the non-conformance of the goods to requirements for the goods under 
          the contract within a reasonable period of time after the non-conformance 
          is noticed or should have been noticed, specifying the nature of the 
          non-conformance, or it will lose the right to claim compensation for 
          this non-conformance.' That is to say, if the buyer fails to notify 
          the seller in time, the seller has reason to believe that the goods 
          delivered fulfill their requirements under the contract and the buyer 
          can no longer claim damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The claimant in 
          this case could and should have inspected the goods at the port of destination 
          of Hamburg, Germany. If a problem was found with the quality of the 
          goods, it could reject the goods, claim compensation for losses or take 
          other steps to remedy the situation, as the case may be. Instead of 
          doing this it resold the goods to its client without first inspecting 
          the goods. It was only when the client raised the quality problem that 
          the claimant arranged for the goods to be inspected by the inspection 
          authorities. By this time, the 90-day period of inspection after the 
          arrival of the goods at the port of destination agreed upon in the contract 
          had already expired and the client had used part of the goods. The above 
          actions of the claimant are deemed to be indications that the claimant 
          had accepted the goods and there is no doubt that the claimant had therefore 
          lost its right to reject the goods. Had it also lost its, right to claim 
          damages? There is no explicit provision on this in the Convention, but 
          this conclusion can be reached from the above provisions even though 
          there are different provisions or rulings in the laws and cases of some 
          countries. According to British law, the above actions of the buyer 
          would be deemed to be counter to the seller's title to the goods. The 
          buyer is deemed to have accepted the goods and to have lost the right 
          to reject the goods, but it may still claim damages for breach of warranty 
          on the part of the seller.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
