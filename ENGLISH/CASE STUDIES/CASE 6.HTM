            claimant asked the respondent to take back the goods. Pursuant to 
            the contract, the seller should take back, without charge, goods which 
            do not conform with requirements for the goods under the contract. 
            But the contract also provided that the buyer should base its request

            Bureau. Investigations showed, however, that there was no PRC inspection 
            authority at the port of destination in Mexico. According to international 
            trade practice, the buyer should have then asked an independent third 
            party and the seller to carry out the reinspection. In this case, 
            IFF was the claimant's client; it was therefore inappropriate for 
            the claimant to request the return of the goods on the basis of the 
            certificate of inspection issued by IFF. However, the parties had 
            already agreed that the goods could be returned. A dispute arose regarding 
            responsibility for the payment of the freight costs. The claimant

            perishable, or if the preservation of the goods involves unreasonable 
            expenses, the buyer, who has the obligation to preserve the goods, 
            must take necessary steps to sell the goods and, as far as possible,

            1993 were also taken into account, the storage costs would be US$17,000,

            circumstances, since the respondent, as the seller, failed to redeliver 
            the goods within a reasonable period of time, this gave the claimant 
            the relief that would have been available to it if the seller had 
            not delivered the goods. Replacement of goods had therefore become 
            return of goods, The problem is that, during the return of the goods, 
            the claimant, by mistake, failed to return the goods to the respondent 
            and controlled the goods instead. It did not endeavour to return the 
            goods to the respondent as instructed by the respondent; nor did it 
            seek further instructions from the respondent on whether it should 
            dispose of the goods. The claimant therefore lost the relief that 
            would have been available to it if the seller had not delivered the 
            goods.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

            the fact that the respondent also made mistakes in the process of 
            returning the goods, it is reasonable for the arbitration tribunal 
            to decide on an equitable solution, that the respondent should pay 
            a certain amount of compensation to the claimant and bear part of 
            the freight costs for the return of the goods.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>The conclusion we 
            can draw from this case is as follows: when the buyer notices that 
            goods are defective, it must, in order to be able to exercise its 
            right to reject the goods, notify the seller and seek the seller's 
            instructions on the disposal of the goods within a reasonable period 
            of time. After obtaining reasonable instructions from the seller regarding 
            disposal of the goods, the buyer must follow these instructions exactly. 
            Any consequences arising from its failure to follow the seller's instructions 
            exactly, due to mistakes on its own part, will result in the buyer 
            having to bear responsibility. In such a situation, it will suffer 
            losses that could and should have been avoided.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
