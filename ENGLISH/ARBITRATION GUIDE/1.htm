      <p> 　　 China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (hereinafter referred to as CIETAC, also named as the Court of Arbitration of China Chamber of International Commerce as from Oct.1, 2000) is a permanent international commercial arbitration institution, which independently and impartially resolves, by means of arbitration, contractual or non-contractual, economic and trade disputes. CIETAC, formerly called the Foreign Trade Arbitration Commission, was set up in April 1956 within the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade in accordance with the Decision of May 6, 1954 by the former Government Administration council of the Central People¨s Government of the People¨s Republic of China. To meet the needs of the continuing development of China¨s economic and trade relations with foreign countries after the adoption of the reform and opening-up policy, the Foreign Trade Arbitration Commission was changed to the Foreign Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission in 1980 and then renamed the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission in 1988. </p>
      <p>　　 After nearly five decades of unremitting and pioneering efforts to improve its service, CIETAC enjoys a wide reputation domestically and internationally for its independence, impartiality, efficiency and expeditiousness in handling cases, and has become one of the major commercial arbitration institutions in the world. There are parties from 60 countries and regions other than China involved in CIETAC arbitration cases. CIETAC awards are accepted as fair and impartial both at home and abroad and could be recognized and enforced in 134 countries. CIETAC has become one of the major commercial arbitration centers around the world.</p>
      <p>　　 CIETAC takes cognizance of cases not only all kinds of international, foreign-related disputes, but also all kinds of domestic disputes. </p>
      <p>　　 CIETAC has its headquarters in Beijing. The South China Sub-Commission and Shanghai Sub-Commission were established respectively in 1984 and 1990 in view of the expansion of arbitration activities. The Beijing Headquarters of CIETAC and its two Sub-Commissions are one institution. They use the same Arbitration Rules and Panel of Arbitrators and they exercise the same arbitration jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>　　 In February 1984, South China Sub-Commission (formerly called Shenzhen office, renamed Shenzhen Sub-Commission in 1989, and South China Sub-Commission in 2004) was established with the permission of the State Council, which has a Secretariat that is responsible for daily work under the instructions of the Secretary-General. The establishment of South China Sub-Commission makes a great contribution to the convenience of merchants and investors from Southeast-Asian countries and regions, especially from Hong Kong SAR, Macao SAR, Taiwan region and Southern parts of China, to settle their commercial disputes as soon as possible. It also greatly improved the environment of investment in southern parts of China. </p>
      <p>　　 After 20 years exploration and development, the number of the submitted cases in South China Sub-Commission has been raised year by year, including but not limited to Trade, Investment, Finance, Insurance, Project Construction and Real Estate, and the parties of cases cover different domestic regions and more than 40 countries located in different continents around the world. The impartiality of the awards has been domestically and internationally acknowledged and there are over 100 awards, which have been successfully enforced outside China. Moreover, South China Sub-Commission has set up a good communication and cooperation relationship with over 20 international arbitration institutions around the world. <br>
