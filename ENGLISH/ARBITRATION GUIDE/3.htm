    <td width="95%" align="left" valign="top"> <p class="cjn">　　　CIETAC has become 
        one of the major commercial arbitration centers around the world. Arbitration 
        in CIETAC has the following advantages, especially in China:<br>
        <strong><font size="4"><br>
        　　 </font></strong> <strong><font size="4">Independence and impartiality</font></strong> 
        <br>
        　　　CIETAC is established by China Chamber of International Commerce (CCIC), 
        a non-governmental institution and does not attach itself to any administrative 
        organs and other official institutions. It independently and impartially 
        resolves disputes between parties only according to facts and law and 
        is not subject to any outer interference. <br>
        <strong><br>
        　　　<font size="4">International Arbitrators with Specialized Knowledge</font></strong> 
        <br>
        　　　The present Panels of Arbitrators, in which there are more than 600 
        arbitrators, including one-third foreigners from more than thirty countries. 
        Most of them are famous specialists or scholars in legal, commercial, 
        financial and technical fields.<br>
      </p>
      <p class="cjn"><strong>　　　<font size="4">Internationalized Arbitration Rules</font></strong><br>
        　　　CIETAC revised its arbitration rules respectively in 1988, 1994, 1995, 
        1998 and 2000, and made its Financial Disputes Arbitration Rules effective 
        as from May 8, 2003. Now the Arbitration Rules of CIEATC have become much 
        more international and flexible. <br>
      </p>
      <p class="cjn"><strong>　　　<font size="4">International and national recognition 
        of its awards</font></strong><br>
        　　　&quot;1958 New York Convention&quot; became effective to China on April 
        22, 1987, which facilitates enforcement of CIETAC's awards in all contracting 
        states. <br>
        <br>
        　　　According to Chinese law, if one party fails to comply with a CIETAC's 
        award, the other party may apply for its enforcement to the intermediate 
        people's court of the place where the party against whom the application 
        for enforcement is made has his domicile or where his property is located. 
        <br>
        <br>
        　　　Up to now, hundreds of awards made by CIETAC have been recognized and 
        enforced successfully in China and in more than 30 foreign countries.</p>
