      <p>　　　There are usually four options to resolve commercial disputes, i.e. negotiation, conciliation, arbitration and litigation. As an alternative, arbitration has become very popular in the world. Among the alternative dispute resolutions, arbitration has a number of inherent and unique advantages over other alternatives, namely: <br>
      </p>
      <p> Simplified Procedures and Flexibility<br>
          　　　 Arbitration is faster and less expensive than litigation in the courts. Although a complex international dispute may sometimes take a great deal of time and money to resolve, even by means of arbitration, the limited scope for challenge against an arbitral award, as compared with a court judgment, offers an obvious advantage. Above all, it helps to ensure that the parties will not subsequently be entangled in a prolonged and costly series of appeals. Furthermore, it offers the parties the flexibility to set up proceedings that can be conducted as quickly and economically as the circumstances allow. <br>
      </p>
      <p>　　 Sufficient Autonomy of the Parties<br>
          　　　 Judicial systems do not allow the parties to a dispute to choose their own judges. In contrast, arbitration offers the parties the unique opportunity to designate persons of their choice as arbitrators, provided they are independent. This enables the parties to have their disputes resolved by people who have specialized competence in the relevant field. <br>
        　　　 In arbitration, parties are free to make provisions as to the following key matters: Place of arbitration, Language used, Procedures or rules of law applied, Nationality of the arbitrators and so on.<br>
      </p>
      <p> Confidentiality <br>
          　　　 Arbitration hearings are not conducted in open sessions, and only the parties themselves receive copies of the awards.<br>
      </p>
      <p>　　　Reasonable Costs<br>
          　　　 The arbitration award is final and the procedure of arbitration is faster than litigation. Therefore, arbitration is cheaper than litigation.<br>
      </p>
      <p>　　　Final and Binding Decisions<br>
          　　　 While the mechanisms of negotiation and conciliation can help parties reach an amicable settlement, they depend, ultimately, on the goodwill and cooperation of the parties, they are not final and enforceable decisions. In fact, a final and enforceable decision can generally be obtained only by recourse to a court or by arbitration. Because arbitral awards are not subject to appeal, they are much more likely to be final than the judgments of courts of first instance. Although arbitral awards may be subject to being challenged, the grounds of challenge available against arbitral awards are limited to procedural irregularities. <br>
      </p>
      <p>　　　International Recognition of Arbitral Awards <br>
          　　　 Arbitral awards enjoy much greater international recognition than judgments of national courts. Over 130 countries have signed the 1958 United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, known as the &quot;New York Convention&quot;. The Convention facilitates enforcement of awards in all contracting states. <br>
